"""
URL Migration Tool package.

This __init__.py file serves multiple purposes:
1. Marks the 'src' directory as a Python package, allowing its modules to be imported
2. Controls what is exposed when importing the package (e.g., 'from src import *')
3. Runs any necessary package initialization code
4. Can define the package's public API by setting __all__
5. Enables relative imports between modules within the package

Without this file, Python would not treat the directory as a package.
